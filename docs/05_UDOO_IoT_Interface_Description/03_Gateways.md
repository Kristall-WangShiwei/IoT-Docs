From the 3-dot menu you can also manage other features of the Gateway such as:
* **Restart All Services**: If you detect some connection issues, try to restart the Services (*udoo-iot-cloud-client*) installed.
* **Set Geolocation**: To set the geolocation of the Gateway and check the pin in the Dashboard map.
* **Scan for UDOO Blu**: Scan the BLE network of the Gateway to connect a new wireless [UDOO BLU](https://www.udoo.org/udoo-blu/) that will send data of the sensor to this Gateway.
* **Scan for Open Z-Wave**: If you have connected an USB Z-Wave receiver stick to the Gateway, you can scan the network to automatically identify Open Z-Wave nodes and control it by the UDOO Cloud.  
Here you can find some info about the [Z-Wave protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Wave), the [Open Z-Wave implementation](http://www.openzwave.com/) and a list of all the [compatible device supported](http://www.openzwave.com/device-database).
* **Delete Gateway**: Delete the Gateway registration in the UDOO Cloud account.
