There are some Bricks that return the values of more than one sensor (e.g. The Humidity Sensor returns data from Humidity sensor and Temperature sensor).
For the Bricks that have more sensors, you can select two kind of visualizations:
* United
* Divided

If you select **United**, a widget will be created that has all the values of the Brickâ€™s sensors, as show in the figures below
