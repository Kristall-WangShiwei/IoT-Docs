To make the UDOO IoT Client service work on your UDOO board you need the `udoo-iot-cloud-client` package installed on your system.  
The package is available for both ARM or x86 architecture so it can run on UDOO ARM-based boards and UDOO x86-based boards.
This package provides the service and all what you need to make your UDOO board communicate with the UDOO IoT Cloud Server.

## Prepare the IoT Client

Check the right section accordingly with the boad you want to register in the UDOO IoT Cloud.

### UDOO ARM/based board (UDOO NEO & UDOO QUAD/DUAL)

First of all you need a microSD with the UDOObuntu OS installed.  

If you haven't a microSD with UDOObuntu yet, go to the [Prepare the IoT Client with no OS installed](!Prepare_the_IoT_Client_with_no_OS_installed) page to download and flash the last version of UDOObuntu on a microSD.

If you already have a UDOObuntu version previous of the **2.2.0** on your UDOO board you need to update/upgrade it with new packages and install the IoT client.  
Go to the [Prepare the IoT Client with OS already installed](!Prepare_the_IoT_Client_with_OS_already_installed) section to know how to configure a previous version of UDOObuntu.

### UDOO X86 board

You need to run a Linux distro to install the UDOO IoT Client.  
For now, the packages are compatible with **Ubuntu 17.10 (Artful Aardvark)** and **Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus)**.


## Install the UDOO IoT Client service

Install the UDOO IoT Client service is very easy.  
Go to the [Install the UDOO Iot Client service](!Install_the_UDOO_Iot_Client_service) section to see how to do that in your UDOO NEO, QUAD/DUAL or X86 board.
