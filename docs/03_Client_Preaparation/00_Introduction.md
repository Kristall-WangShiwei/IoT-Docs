To make the UDOO IoT service work on your UDOO board you need the `udoo-iot-cloud-client` package installed on your system.  
This package provides the service and all what you need to make your UDOO board communicate with the UDOO IoT Cloud Server.

Starting from **UDOObuntu version 2.1.4** the `udoo-iot-cloud-client` package comes pre-installed in the system, but not active.

If you haven't a MicroSD with the OS yet, follow this link to go to the [Get Started with UDOO NEO](https://www.udoo.org/get-started-neo/) page and flash UDOObuntu on a MicroSD.

If you already have an Operating System on your UDOO board you need to update it with new packages. Go to the next section to know how to configure a previous version of UDOObuntu.
