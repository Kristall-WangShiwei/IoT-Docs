To make the UDOO IoT service work on your UDOO board you need the `udoo-iot-cloud-client` package installed on your system.  
This package provides the service and all what you need to make your UDOO board communicate with the UDOO IoT Cloud Server.

Starting from **UDOObuntu version 2.1.4** the `udoo-iot-cloud-client` package comes pre-installed in the system, but not active.

### Prepare the IoT Client with no OS installed

If you haven't a microSD with UDOObuntu yet, go to the [Prepare the IoT Client with no OS installed](!Client_Preparation/Prepare_the_IoT_Client_with_no_OS_installed) page to and flash UDOObuntu on a microSD.

### Prepare the IoT Client with OS already installed

If you already have a UDOObuntu version previous of the **2.1.4** on your UDOO board you need to update it with new packages and install the IoT client.  
Go to the [Prepare the IoT Client with OS already installed](!Client_Preparation/Prepare_the_IoT_Client_with_OS_already_installed) section to know how to configure a previous version of UDOObuntu.
