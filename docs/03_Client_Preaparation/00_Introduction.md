To make the UDOO IoT service work on your UDOO board you need the `udoo-iot-cloud-client` package installed on your system.  
This package provides the service and all what you need to make your UDOO board communicate with the UDOO IoT Cloud Server.

First of all you need a microSD with the UDOO OS installed.

### Prepare the IoT Client with no OS installed

If you haven't a microSD with UDOObuntu yet, go to the [Prepare the IoT Client with no OS installed](!Prepare_the_IoT_Client_with_no_OS_installed) page to download and flash the last version of UDOObuntu on a microSD.

### Prepare the IoT Client with OS already installed

If you already have a UDOObuntu version previous of the **2.1.4** on your UDOO board you need to update/upgrade it with new packages and install the IoT client.  
Go to the [Prepare the IoT Client with OS already installed](!Prepare_the_IoT_Client_with_OS_already_installed) section to know how to configure a previous version of UDOObuntu.

### Install the UDOO IoT Client service

Install the UDOO IoT Client service is very easy. Go to the [Install the UDOO Iot Client service](!Install_the_UDOO_Iot_Client_service) section to see how to do that.
